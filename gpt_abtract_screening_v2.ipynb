    "after multiple iterations some remaining classifications by the LLM still do not align with the ground truth. Using CoT reasoning we can look at why the LLM classified it accordingly and using Human in the Loop testing see wether or not some of the remaining articles might have been misclassified by the coder. In general, the line for what counts as included or excluded remains blurry. This leaves a blurry classification threshold, where including or excluding a paper can be seen as reasonable, if grounded by good arguments. Using reasoning supplied by the CoT approach we can determine wether or not these classifications are clearly false or not.\n",

    "\n",
    "Abstract: '© 2023 The Authors. GeoHealth published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Geophysical Union.Compressor stations maintain pressure along natural gas pipelines to sustain gas flow. Unfortunately, they present human health concerns as they release chemical pollutants into the air, sometimes at levels higher than national air quality standards. Further, compressor stations are often placed in rural areas with higher levels of poverty and/or minority populations, contributing to environmental justice concerns. In this paper we investigate what chemical pollutants are emitted by compressor stations, the impacts of emitted pollutants on human health, and local community impacts. Based on the information gained from these examinations, we provide the following policy recommendations with the goal of minimizing harm to those affected by natural gas compressor stations: the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and relevant state agencies must increase air quality monitoring and data transparency; the EPA should direct more resources to monitoring programs specifically at compressor stations; the EPA should provide free indoor air quality monitoring to homes near compressor stations; the EPA needs to adjust its National Ambient Air Quality Standards to better protect communities and assess cumulative impacts; and decision-makers at all levels must pursue meaningful involvement from potentially affected communities. We find there is substantial evidence of negative impacts to strongly support these recommendations.'\n",

    "- The abstract centers on the disproportionate health impacts of compressor stations on low‑income and minority communities, explicitly framing the issue as an environmental justice concern.\n",
    "- It provides an empirical assessment of pollutant exposure and health outcomes stratified by socio‑economic/racial context and offers EJ‑focused policy recommendations.'\n",

    "\n",
    "- at first the revised prompts have a very large effect on the improvement of the classifications\n",
    "- the prompt understands the underlying intentions of the human more clearly by comparing ground truth with its own classification and tries to understand why it is false\n",
    "    - the critial agent attempts to understand the **actual** intention of the human compared to what it wrote in the original Prompt.\n",
    "    - the revision agent then attempts to edit the prompt in a way to reflect the actual intention of the human using the criticizm it got from the critical agent\n",
    "    - the new prompt is then used to classify the articles. (on a structural level the question remains if the entire training set should be used or if it should be tested only on a subset of falsley classified ones)\n",
    "    - additionally the question remains if this can be scaled to any additional abtract screening question or not (it might get complicated extracting all the text from papers for the full text coding. I could imagine that this step will have to be done manually. then the \"reading\" itself can maybe be done using a simple text extraction tool and a regular coding. However, this would use a significant amount of computing resources it would probably still be cheaper than letting student assisants do it.)\n"

      "© 2021 Elsevier Inc.Research spanning several disciplines has repeatedly documented disproportionate pollution exposure in low-income communities and communities of color. Among the various proposed causes of this pattern, those that have received the most attention are income inequality, discrimination, and firm costs (of inputs and regulatory compliance). We argue that an additional channel – information – is likely to play an important role in generating disparities in pollution exposure. We present multiple reasons for a tendency to underestimate pollution burdens. Using a model of housing choice, we then derive conditions under which “hidden” pollution leads to an inequality — even when all households face the same lack of information. This inequality arises when households sort according to known pollution and other disamenities, which we show are positively correlated with hidden pollution. To help bridge the gap between environmental justice and economics, we discuss the relationship between hidden information and three different distributional measures: exposure to pollution; exposure to hidden pollution; and welfare loss due to hidden pollution.\n",

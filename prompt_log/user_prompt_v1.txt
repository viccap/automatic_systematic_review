**Example 1 — Critical/conceptual EJ Framework**  
Title: “The Gathering Momentum for Environmental Justice in Brazil”  
Abstract: “It will be argued in this paper that the problematic of social cohesion is also one of socio-ecological cohesion whereby the urbanisation of nature and its socio-environmentally enabling and disabling conditions are key processes. By viewing the contradictions of the urbanisation process as intrinsically socio-ecological ones, the terrain of social cohesion is shifted both epistemologically and politically. The paper critically examines three contemporary schools of thought that consider in different ways the relationship between cities, social cohesion and the environment. It begins with a critical examination of the notion of urban sustainability. The paper will then move on to consider two approaches that emphasise issues of (in)equality and (in)justice in the urban environment, those of environmental justice and urban political ecology. The final part of the paper pinpoints four areas of research that urban researchers must examine if we are to understand more fully-and act more politically on-the nexus between cities, social cohesion and the environment. © 2012 Urban Studies Journal Limited."
Decision reasoning:
- "EJ is central to the aim and argument."
- "Presents a theoretical framework/reconceptualization."
Decision: **INCLUDE**

**Example 2 — Empirical stratification + EJ screen tool**  
Title: “Exposure to urban rats as a community stressor among low-income urban residents”  
Abstract: “This paper tests the validity of proximity as an estimate for environmental health hazard exposure, and suggests how it may be used as an indicator in future environmental health and justice research. Using geostatistics and geographic information systems, air pollution monitoring data in Hamilton, Canada are interpolated to obtain local estimates of total suspended particulates. These estimates are used address the following questions: How does the distribution of proximity to health hazards compare with monitored air pollution data? Does the use of proximity rather than air pollution data significantly change the substantive conclusions of environmental injustice in models with sociodemographic data? The results show that proximity measures can be useful indicators if flexibly applied. Guidelines for future applications are discussed. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

**Example 3 — EJ only in introduction**  
Title: “Does oil and gas development increase crime within UK local authorities?”  
Abstract: “© 2018 The AuthorsThere is a renewed interest in expanding domestic oil and gas development in the United Kingdom (UK). However, the potential social consequences of this expansion are still unknown. Thus, the current study assesses whether the number of spudded oil and gas wells are correlated with violent and property crime rates within 69 local authorities between 2004 and 2015 (n = 828). Fixed effects regression analyses indicate that wells are positively correlated with violent crime rates. That is, each additional well is associated with a 1.5% increase in violent crime. When the analysis is limited to those local authorities that have constructed the most wells, the correlation between wells and crime increases as the boomtown literature might suggest. In particular, each additional well is associated with a 4.9% increase in violent crime and a 4.9% increase in property crime. We conclude by pointing out that this study stands as the first to empirically examine the relationship between oil and gas development and crime within UK local authorities over time and suggest that results have important implications for crime, social disorganisation and environmental justice."
Decision Reasoning:
- "EJ is only mentioned in background."
- "Race is only a control variable; no EJ framing or theory."
Decision: **EXCLUDE**

**Example 4 — EJ not subject of study**  
Title: “Does oil and gas development increase crime within UK local authorities?”  
Abstract: “Densely populated states like New York and New Jersey are challenged to find new and less expensive landfill space as their existing facilities reach capacity or are forced to close. For less densely populated states the challenge is to limit out-of-state access to their landfill space-realizing that the space will probably be needed for their own citizens' garbage. For poor communities the challenge is to keep landfills and incinerators out of their neighborhoods-a challenge that has spawned, in part, the environmental justice movement. These and other so-called "not in my backyard" or "NIMBY" groups exacerbate the siting problem. Thus waste distribution raises both legal and political controversies. In this Article we examine more closely the solid waste crisis triggered by the federal courts' Commerce Clause jurisprudence. First, we explore the doctrinal impediments to a Pigovian solution. We note, not surprisingly, that state courts seem not only more sensitive to local ] concerns than do federal courts, they also seem more inclined to uphold both cost-shifting and cost-internalizing local regulations against Commerce Clause challenges. Second, we develop further a proposed solution to the waste crisis mentioned in our earlier article. Based on the notion that neither the courts nor Congress seem likely to provide a solution to this problem in the foreseable future, we propose that the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") use its regulatory authority over solid waste facility siting under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to facilitate the internalization of environmental costs and thereby reduce cost shifting. The advantages of this proposal are two fold: (1) EPA is in a much better position to weigh all factors in siting decisions, including environmental justice issues; (2) Commerce Clause issues would be eliminated because state and local regulations would be removed or subordinated to federal siting policies."
